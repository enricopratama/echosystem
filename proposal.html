      <p class="problem-body">
        Local musicians and performers are struggling to gain visibility and
        support in many communities. These individuals often lack the platform
        to showcase their talents and work, and they find it difficult to
        collaborate with other potential artists. Despite the existing platforms
        such as Instagram or SoundCloud, it is still difficult for them to stand
        out due to the highly saturated and competitive nature of the industry.
        This situation not only hinders local artists from gaining exposure but
        also deprives communities of enriching cultural experiences and the
        opportunity to support their local economy. The problems, however,
        extend beyond mere visibility, they include the difficulty of forming
        meaningful connections and collaborations in the ecosystem of local
        artists. They are struggling to find opportunities that allow them to
        share their work properly whilst engaging with collaborators, and people
        of interest. Addressing these challenges would be crucial to nurturing a
        more vibrant, supportive, and collective community where artists can
        flourish and enrich the cultural fabric of their communities. 
        
        <h1 class="subtitles">APP DESCRIPTION</h1>
        This web app aims to level the playing field for music
        artists from minority groups, prioritizing inclusivity and
        accessibility. It does not only probe as a platform for the artists but
        also to those seeking for talent. It is bound to enhance economic
        empowerment, community networking, educational opportunities, and
        enhanced accessibility. This web app will offer 2 main features and a
        minor feature to engage with its users. The first feature is the
        Collaboration and Crowdfunding platform, where artists can publish their
        work to look for funding or collaboration. Other users can explore these
        projects, make financial contributions, or search for talent. In
        addition to fostering artistic partnerships, this platform makes
        community-supported funding possible, enabling artists to complete
        projects that otherwise might not have been feasible owing to budgetary
        limitations. The second feature that we are planning to implement is
        called “Masterclasses Sessions With Well-known Artists”. End-users who
        are interested in booking an appointment with a renown-artist from
        various fields and intend to learn from their talents and gain more
        opportunities. We plan to incorporate some sort of list of artists and
        the variety of disciplines that they teach. Users can then click to book
        an appointment, or also move the specific artist to another list of
        ‘favorite artists’. Overall, this section seeks to offer inspiration,
        skill development, and educational value by offering special learning
        opportunities and insights into the professional world of art, bridging
        the gap between local talent and seasoned industry experts.

      <h1 class="subtitles">Accessibility Features for Users with Disabilities:</h1>
      <p class="problem-body"> 
        The call for heightened awareness regarding accessibility in web design is important. Universal design principles are essential in crafting digital platforms that cater inclusively to all users, including those with disabilities. By embedding these principles, we create an environment where artists of all abilities can thrive equally, thus enriching the tapestry of our musical culture with diverse expressions. 
        Initiatives that prioritize these values may begin by addressing the needs of the visually impaired. Such measures would include ensuring compatibility with screen readers, offering high contrast modes, and providing options to adjust text size, thus accommodating individuals with varying degrees of visual ability. This approach not only levels the playing field for artists with physical challenges but also signifies a stride toward a more empathetic and wide-ranging creative community.</p>
