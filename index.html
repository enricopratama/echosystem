      <p>
        Local musicians and performers are struggling to gain visibility and
        support in many communities. These individuals often lack the platform
        to showcase their talents and work, and they find it difficult to
        collaborate with other potential artists. Despite the existing platforms
        such as Instagram or SoundCloud, it is still difficult for them to stand
        out due to the highly saturated and competitive nature of the industry.
        This situation not only hinders local artists from gaining exposure but
        also deprives communities of enriching cultural experiences and the
        opportunity to support their local economy. The problems, however,
        extend beyond mere visibility, they include the difficulty of forming
        meaningful connections and collaborations in the ecosystem of local
        artists. They are struggling to find opportunities that allow them to
        share their work properly whilst engaging with collaborators, and people
        of interest. Addressing these challenges would be crucial to nurturing a
        more vibrant, supportive, and collective community where artists can
        flourish and enrich the cultural fabric of their communities.
