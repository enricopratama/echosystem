    <h1>EchoSystem Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
    <p>Local musicians and performers are struggling to gain visibility and support in many communities.
      These individuals often lack the platform to showcase their talents and work, and they find it difficult to collaborate with other potential artists.
      Despite the existing platforms such as Instagram or SoundCloud, it is still difficult for them to stand out due to the highly saturated and competitive nature of the industry.
      This situation not only hinders local artists from gaining exposure but also deprives communities of enriching cultural experiences and the opportunity to support their local economy.
      The problems, however, extend beyond mere visibility, they include the difficulty of forming meaningful connections and collaborations in the ecosystem of local artists.
      They are struggling to find opportunities that allow them to share their work properly whilst engaging with collaborators, and people of interest.
      Addressing these challenges would be crucial to nurturing a more vibrant, supportive, and collective community where artists can flourish and enrich the cultural fabric of their communities.
